\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{his} chapter describes the hardware used to realize out
the project. Where the use of the Raspberry Pi single board computer designed to
have high performance both in education and science coupled with 8 mega-pixel
camera module CMOS sensor was an almost conditioned choice. Shows that
scientific and engineering--grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi
3 and its V2.1 camera module. It also presents a brief introduction to
thermography and its physical principles before introducing Lepton 2.5 thermal
camera module, made by the company FLIR which is currently one of the top
manufactures of thermal camera solutions. The Coral Dev Board is a single-board
computer that contains an Edge TPU coprocessor. It's ideal for prototyping new
projects that demand fast on-device inferencing for machine learning models. The
Coral Dev Board is ideal when you need to perform fast machine learning (ML)
inferencing in a small form factor.
