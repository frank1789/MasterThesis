\lettrine[lines=3]{D}{eep} Learning has exploded to the present day because it
has become accessible to the general public. Often its contribution is
noticeable in intelligent systems as assistants and interpreters of natural
language and prototypes of self-driving vehicle systems. In this document, we
try to provide a thorough investigation of deep learning in its applications and
mechanisms. In particular, as a categorical state of the art collection in
research on deep learning. An impetus in deep learning technologies was imparted
by Google in 2015 thanks to TensorFlow. TensorFlow supports computation on
multiple CPUs and GPUs, with optional CUDA and SYCL extensions. In addition,
TensorFlow Lite is designed for mobile and embedded machine learning, and
provides an Android Neural Networks API.\cite{article}
