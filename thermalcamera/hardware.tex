\section{Thermal Camera module Lepton 2.5}

The thermal camera module we use in thi project, we will go through its specification, modes of capture and communication protocol for both video frame transfer and camera control.
Information about the camera are extracted from official documentation.

\subsection{Specification}
In this project we use a Lepton 2.5 thermal camera module, made by the company FLIR which is currently one of the top manufactures of thermal camera solutions. It contains a sensor sensitive to long wave infra red (LWIR) light in range from 8 to 14 \si{\micro\meter}.
The camera module is smaller than a dime and provides decent images with its 160 by 120 pixels resolution. The effective frame rate of the camera is only 8.8 \si{\hertz}, however for our needs this is not a problem. The camera only requires low voltage supply and has small power consumption of around 140 \si{\milli\watt}. See table 3.1 for more specifications.
For better manipulation with the camera module we use a breakout board (figure 3.1) with a housing for the Lepton camera module. The breakout board provides better physical accessibility, improves heat dissipation and increases input voltage supply range to 3-5 volts, as it has its own regulated power supply. This power supply provides the camera module with three necessary voltages: 1.2, 2.8 and 2.8-3.1 \si{\volt}. The breakout board also supplies the camera with master clock signal. [14] The camera uses two interfaces for communication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SPI for transferring video frames from the camera to a SPI master device.
    \item I$^{2}$C for receiving control commands from the I$^{2}$C master device.
\end{itemize}
Even though the name of the project include the keyword low-cost, we need to think of this statement with respect to the thermal camera market. The Lepton 3 thermal camera module can be considered low-cost when compared to other thermal camera devices available‚Äîas it costs around $250$ (2018) 4.
This could however be considerably more when compared to other nonthermal solutions, however way more than if we would utilize a simple infrared counting sensors for example.
