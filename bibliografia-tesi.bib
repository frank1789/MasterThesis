	Abstract = {Although the research on autonomous mobile robot SLAM has received extensive research, the current mobile robot still exists in practical applications: it may move under the condition of disordered and irregular obstacle placement; the shape of the obstacle and the position of the obstacle change; and indoor and outdoor scene switching occurs at different times and other issues. Autonomous mobile robots need to continuously optimize SLAM during motion and obtain real-time information from multiple sensors for real-time identification and rapid response to the surrounding environment. We have improved the CNN-based VSLAM system by replacing the original single convolutional layer with parallelism and reducing the number of model parameters. This approach can reduce the problem of system gradient disappearance and continue to train deeper networks. Finally, a global map is generated with the fully connected layer and passed to the robot's navigation. The experimental results based on RGB-D SLAM Dataset and Benchmark database dataset show that the proposed VSLAM system based on CNN is superior to the traditional CNN VSLAM system in both ATE and RPE indicators.},

@article{Boucher:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Remotely piloted aviation systems (RPAS) or `drones'are well known for their military applications, but could also be used for a range of non-military applications for state, industrial, commercial and recreational purposes. The technology is advanced and regulatory changes are underway which will allow their use in domestic airspace. As well as the functional and economic benefits of a strong civil RPAS sector, the potential benefits for the military RPAS sector are also widely recognised. Several actors have nurtured this dual-use aspect of civil RPAS development. However, concerns have been raised about the public rejecting the technology because of their association with military applications and potentially controversial applications, for example in policing and border control. In contrast with the enthusiasm for dual-use exhibited throughout the EC consultation process, the strategy for avoiding public rejection devised in its roadmap would downplay the connection between military and non-military RPAS and focus upon less controversial applications such as search and rescue. We reflect upon this contrast in the context of the European agenda of responsible research and innovation. In doing so, we do not rely upon critique of drones per se, in their neither their civil nor military guise, but explore the extent to which current strategies for managing their public acceptability are compatible with a responsible and socially beneficial development of RPAS for civil purposes.},
