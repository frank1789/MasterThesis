\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{his} chapter describes the software developed for the
hardware described in the chapter \ref{chap:hardware}. The choice to use the Qt
framework guarantees the portability and cross-platform support, as well
as the graphical interface and high data performance the feature of compiled
languages.  The software is divided into two programs capable of communicating
with each other: the first works on Raspberry Pi and allows the user to
interface easily with the FLIR thermal camera and with the Raspicam camera. 
It also acts as a TCP server to send the images shot to connected devices. 
The second part is a client program that receives the data sent by the main
device, and allows the analysis of the image through machine learning on
dedicated hardware.
