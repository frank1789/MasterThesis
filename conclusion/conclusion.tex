\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he aim} of this thesis is to increase automation and 
calculation skills on board the drone with the help of the machine learning, 
solving the computer vision problem and in particular object detection problem. 
The system uses a standard camera with a resolution of 8 MegaPixels to acquire 
images that will be processed by the neural network, as it can rely on the
Lepton 2.5 thermal camera to detect objects that they emit heat. 
In particular, the software created is designed to exploit as much as possible
the parallelization of the processor, precisely to manage the flow videos from
the cameras. The Raspberry Pi 3b has wifi connection therefore the software uses
it on a TCP socket to send two flows to a possible device connected to the same
network. 
Thus it is possible to carry out the inference with the model directly on board
neural that in the case of color images will try to identify the carpet landing,
while in the case of the thermal camera the second model neural will try to
identify any obstacles, in this case people, to avoid them during the execution
of the maneuvers. 
As discussed the use of deep learning allows you to solve a specific problem
calibrating the response on the input data to have the classification in
response of the object and its position within the frame captured by the camera.
In particular using the single shot detection model based on MobileNet, it
provides excellent results both in the classification of subjects framed as well
as the position of bounding box that frames the same. 
The fine tuning techniques thus allow you to train the in a short time model to
classify a specific target. Clearly this is not possible to do on board the
drone, but high devices are required computational services such as the
University HPC cluster made available. Using the TensorFlow Lite framework to
compress the model once it has been trained, so you can choose to use floating
point or integer values. 
In particular, using a compressed model allows it to be used on embedded
devices, typically less performing, as they can be computer board card, such as
the Raspberry Pi 3b used in this project, thus providing acceptable performance.
The TPU mounted on the Coral Dev-Board  was used instead of the processors shows
how it is still possible to increase the response speed of the neural model
thanks to the heavy use of 8-bit integers. 
Although the benefits are significant the compression  reached penalizes the
final result at the end of the inference process due to the big difference
between the architectures of the processors, the optimizations introduced by the
compiler and the user affect the recognition of the target thus producing a
slight increase in cases of false positives. 
Although it is possible to code any model in TensorFlow Lite this is it is not
always possible, in fact by using custom layers they can prevent the compression
of the trained model. For this reason, during the development phase of the
neural network, it was decided to use a network from the TensorFlow API unlike
the preliminary phases in which a customized model had been adopted, therefore
the model is more compatible with TensorFlow Lite. 
It presents the right balance between accuracy and speed of execution, this also
ensured full compatibility with the TPU. Ultimately it is possible to remark
that the work done here produces a system able to increase the capabilities of a
drone thanks to the help of deep learning without resorting to pre-existing
solutions deriving from closed licenses or commercial combined with devices for
sale.
