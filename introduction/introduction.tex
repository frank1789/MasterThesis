\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he number} of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is 
increasing and become an attractive increasingly in recent 
years.\cite{Boucher:2015aa,daponte2017measurement} 
Studies are in progress on UAVs to utilize as an ideal platform for civilian
tasks or military tasks, such as inspection, delivery, reconnaissance, or
surveillance like the mobile robots based on autonomous navigation, real-time
path planning, and object recognition.\cite{Wang_2018, zhang2016deep}
Meanwhile, UAVs have some challenges for autonomous flight, such as control
strategy including parameter tuning, adaptive control, real-time path planning,
and object recognition under uncertain environments. 
However, these approaches still had difficulties with sensors, system dynamics,
qualities, and so on. 
In recent years, machine learning has become an attractive approach to overcome
these challenges in UAVs for autonomous flight. Machine learning enables UAVs to
recognize patterns or predict them from data without designed programming for
autonomous flight.\cite{advancerobotics2019}
The project's focus on machine learning conjunction autonomous flight, including
control strategies and object recognition.
